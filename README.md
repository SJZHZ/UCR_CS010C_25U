## Sample Output
Since zyBook Lab sometimes provide strange expected output, 
you can try my sample output instead(for comparison).  
The executable file is named "b.out" to avoid overwriting. (If I forgot, rename it.)
1. Download: "b.out" file in certain Lab or Program folder(not demos).
2. Upload: certain zyBook Lab -> code editor -> File -> upload
3. Permission: use "chmod 777 b.out"
4. Run and Compare
```bash
./a.out
# paste the test input
./b.out
# paste the test input

# For a better comparison, try 
./a.out > a.txt
# paste the test input
./b.out > b.txt
# paste the test input
```
